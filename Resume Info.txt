Dragon Survival is a game made with C++ in Visual Studios, it was under a time constraint of a few weeks and does contain a few minor bugs (such as when the player gets hit by a bad guy, the player loses all 3 lives instead of just one because the hit function does not lock itself from being called after it's called once)

Laminia Island was done in JavaScript in Unity under a similar time constraint. Being a 3D game, there was no time to add in graphics and most of what happens (other than movement) is sent to the Debug Log for evaluation. This project was a simulation based project in which the AI had changing goals and made decisions based on proximity to the goal and how desirable the goal was.

Lunar Leap was a tech demo written in C#. 

Solar Games was a huge project using both C# and JavaScript, and most of my work in it was fixing other people's scripts. At the time that I joined the team, the project was no longer running and I was essentially given the project and told "fix this". The files included here are ones that I wrote after I got the project stable and started getting it to progress. Other than the ComedicCommentary script, I only included the scripts that were completely my own. The ComedicCommentary script however, was another broken script that I fixed, and added to giving it quite a bit more functionality. It is very likely that looking through the giant project I overlooked one or two things that I wrote entirely on my own, but after I got the project to a stable point we hired an Armenian team and a lot of the coding from that point forward was collaborative.
